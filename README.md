# Julia Function Overflow Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential overflow issue in a simple Julia function and its solution.

The `bug.jl` file contains the original function, which can encounter overflow errors with large inputs.  The `bugSolution.jl` file offers an improved version that mitigates the risk of overflow.

## Bug Description

The function `myfunction` in `bug.jl` squares positive inputs and negates negative inputs. While functional for small numbers, it's prone to overflow when squaring extremely large positive numbers.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.jl` addresses this by using a more robust approach to avoid overflow, thereby providing a safer and more reliable calculation for a wider range of input values.  See the comments in the code for details.
